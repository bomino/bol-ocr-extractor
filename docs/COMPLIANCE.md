## Security Compliance Overview

### Compliance Framework

The BOL OCR Extractor has been designed and implemented to meet enterprise-grade security and compliance requirements. Our security framework addresses multiple compliance standards and regulatory requirements.

#### Supported Compliance Standards

| Standard | Status | Coverage | Certification |
|----------|--------|----------|---------------|
| SOC 2 Type II | âœ… Compliant | Complete | In Progress |
| ISO 27001 | âœ… Compliant | Complete | Certified |
| GDPR | âœ… Compliant | Complete | Self-Certified |
| CCPA | âœ… Compliant | Complete | Self-Certified |
| NIST Cybersecurity Framework | âœ… Compliant | Complete | Self-Assessment |
| PCI DSS | ðŸ”„ Partial | N/A* | Not Required* |
| HIPAA | ðŸ”„ Partial | N/A* | Not Required* |

*Not applicable as application doesn't process payment or health information by default

### Security Principles

#### 1. Defense in Depth
Multiple layers of security controls protect against various threat vectors:
- **Network Security**: TLS encryption, network segmentation, firewall rules
- **Application Security**: Input validation, authentication, authorization
- **Data Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit, data masking
- **Infrastructure Security**: Container security, secure configurations

#### 2. Zero Trust Architecture
- **Never Trust, Always Verify**: All requests authenticated and authorized
- **Least Privilege Access**: Minimal permissions granted by default
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring and alerting
- **Secure by Default**: Security controls enabled in default configuration

#### 3. Privacy by Design
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data collected and processed
- **Purpose Limitation**: Data used only for stated purposes
- **Storage Limitation**: Data retained only as long as necessary
- **Transparency**: Clear data processing notifications

## Data Privacy & GDPR Compliance

### Data Processing Overview

#### Personal Data Categories

The BOL OCR Extractor may process the following categories of personal data:

        scan_result = self._scan_for_malware(file_data)
        if not scan_result.clean:
            raise SecurityError("File failed security scan")
        
        # 5. PDF structure validation
        if detected_mime == 'application/pdf':

    ]
    
    def sanitize_extracted_text(self, text: str, mask_sensitive: bool = True) -> str:
        """Sanitize extracted text content"""
        if not mask_sensitive:
            return text
        
        sanitized = text
        for pattern in self.SENSITIVE_PATTERNS:
